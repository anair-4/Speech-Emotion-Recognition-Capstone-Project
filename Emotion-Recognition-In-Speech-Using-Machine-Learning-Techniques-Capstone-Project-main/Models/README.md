The models are as follows:

ADB- AdaBoost
GNB - Gaussian Naive Bayes
KNN - K Nearest Neighbours
CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
RF - Random Forest
D_Tree_E - Decision Tree with Entropy as Criterion
D_Tree_G - Decision Tree with Gini as Criterion
LogReg - Logistic Regression

The CNN is stored in both json and .h5 files, and both are needed to load the trained models. 

These models have already been trained on the dataset and can be loaded to the Demo ipynb using joblib (already a part of the code).
